# Root keys are locale codes as strings.
# Values can either be the string name of another locale or a map.
#
# String values are used to expand languages to include a default region.
#
# Map values can have the following keys
#   english: Name of language in English.
#   native: Name of language in the language itself.
#   fallback: Specifies a Rails-level I18n fallback.
#   debug: Causes a language to not show up in the production environment.
#
# Note that pegasus/helpers.rb contains a list of RTL languages (in the
# is_rtl function) that should match this list.
